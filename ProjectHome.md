This application includes a dynamically linked device driver for the Netaccessâ„¢ series boards from Brooktrout Technology (now Dialogic).  The NS301 and PRI-PCI digital trunk interface cards provide T1/E1 digital trunk interfaces as well as high density HDLC protocol engines.  What makes these cards unique is their ability to run more D-channels than there are timeslots whereas all other digital trunk boards support only one D-channel per T1/E1.
